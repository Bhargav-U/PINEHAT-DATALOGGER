**PineHat** is a versatile shield for the ESP32 microcontroller, featuring a micro SD card slot, DS3231 RTC with CR2302 battery, and a 0.96-inch OLED screen. Its stackable design reduces wiring and keeps all GPIO pins accessible, with no interference from the OLED or battery.

Ideal for beginners, PineHat combines multiple components into a single, easy-to-use module.


## Features

- **Micro SD Card Slot**: For data storage and retrieval.
- **DS3231 RTC**: Real-time clock with CR2302 battery backup.
- **0.96-inch OLED Screen**: For display purposes.
- **Stackable Design**: Allows infinite stacking without interfering with GPIO pins.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Simplifies the learning process by integrating multiple modules into one.
- **Reduces Wiring**: Simplifies connections by integrating multiple features into one shield.
- **GPIO Accessibility**: All GPIO pins remain accessible even after stacking the shield.
- **Compact and Efficient**: Saves space and reduces the need for multiple separate modules.
