# PineHat

## Overview

**PineHat** is a versatile shield designed for the ESP32 microcontroller. This shield integrates a micro SD card slot, a DS3231 CR2302 battery-enabled real-time clock, and a 0.96-inch OLED screen into a single unit. The PineHat is infinitely stackable, reducing unwanted wiring and making it easier to use all other GPIO pins on the ESP32. The OLED and battery do not interfere with the ESP32, ensuring seamless operation.

This project aims to help beginners in electronics by providing a single module that replaces the need to buy and manage multiple components.

## Features

- **Micro SD Card Slot**: For data storage and retrieval.
- **DS3231 RTC**: Real-time clock with CR2302 battery backup.
- **0.96-inch OLED Screen**: For display purposes.
- **Stackable Design**: Allows infinite stacking without interfering with GPIO pins.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Simplifies the learning process by integrating multiple modules into one.

## Benefits

- **Reduces Wiring**: Simplifies connections by integrating multiple features into one shield.
- **GPIO Accessibility**: All GPIO pins remain accessible even after stacking the shield.
- **Compact and Efficient**: Saves space and reduces the need for multiple separate modules.
- **Ease of Use**: Ideal for beginners looking to get started with electronics.

## Getting Started

1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Stack the PineHat shield onto the ESP32.
   - Connect any additional peripherals as needed.

2. **Software Setup**:
   - Install the necessary libraries for the OLED screen, RTC, and SD card functionalities.
   - Write or upload your code to the ESP32 using the Arduino IDE or any preferred development environment.

3. **Usage**:
   - Utilize the OLED for displaying information.
   - Use the RTC for timekeeping.
   - Store and retrieve data using the SD card slot.
